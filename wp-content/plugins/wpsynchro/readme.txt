WordPress migration plugin, that migrate database tables, media, plugins, themes and whatever you want. Fully customizable. Setup once, run many times

== Description ==

**Complete Migration Plugin for WP developers, by WP developers**

The only migration tool you will ever need as a professional WordPress developer.
WP Synchro was created to be the migration plugin for developers, with a need to do customized migrations.
You need it done in a fast and easy way, that can be re-run very quickly without any further manual steps.
You can fully customize which database tables you want to move and in PRO version, which files/dirs you want to migrate.

A classic task that WP Synchro handles, is keeping a local development site synchronized with a production site or a staging site in sync with a production site.
You can also push data from your staging or local development enviornment to your production site.

**WP Synchro FREE gives you:**

*   Pull/push database from one site to another site
*   Search/replace in database data (supports serialized data)
*   Handles migration of database table prefixes between sites
*   Select the specific database tables you want to move or just move all
*   Automatic clear cache after migration for popular cache plugins
*   High security - No other sites and servers are involved and all data is encrypted on transfer
*   Setup once - Run multiple times - Perfect for development/staging/production environments

**In addition to this, the PRO version gives you:**

*   File synchronization (such as media, plugins, themes or custom files/dirs)
*   Only synchronize the difference in files, making it super fast
*   Customize the exact synchronization you need - Down to a single file
*   Support for basic authentication (.htaccess username/password)
*   Notification email on success or failure to a list of emails
*   Database backup before migration
*   WP CLI command to schedule synchronizations via cron or other trigger
*   Pretty much the ultimate tool for doing WordPress migrations
*   14 day trial is waiting for you to get started at [WPSynchro.com](https://wpsynchro.com/ "WP Synchro PRO")

**Typical use for WP Synchro:**

 *  Developing websites on local server and wanting to push a website to a live server or staging server
 *  Get a copy of a working production site, with both database and files, to a staging or local site for debugging or development with real data
 *  Generally moving WordPress sites from one place to another, even on a firewalled local network

**WP Synchro PRO version:**

Pro version gives you more features, such as synchronizing files, database backup, notifications, support for basic authentication, WP CLI command and much faster support.
